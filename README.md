# Credits

This project was inspired by the UI design shown in a tutorial by [Do Some Coding](https://www.youtube.com/@DoSomeCoding).

However, all the code — including HTML and CSS — was written entirely by me. I used the tutorial only as a visual reference and implemented the layout and responsiveness from scratch to strengthen my web development skills.
